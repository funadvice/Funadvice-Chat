Funadvice.com Chat
------------------

This is the chat system we use on Funadvice. Its super-simple (maybe too simple), but it works.
I put it here so others wanting something simple could use this.

Requirements:
* Redis
* PHP 5.1 or above

No database is needed/required.


Setup:
------

1. Clone this repository and rename it to your public_html or public folder.

2. Edit chat.php to change the Redis database (uses database 9) as a default

3. You should be ready to go. Point your browser to:
http://chat.yoursite.com/index.php?u=username&r=room

That should bring up the chat interface and you should be in room "room".


Integration with your site:
---------------------------

1. In your site, if you have a roster of users online, you can link each user with their username into a room of whatever name you want.

2. Have it appear in a popup window or something.

3. You can make public rooms, that any user with a username can enter.

4. You are responsible for putting in some kind of alert system for 1 to 1 chat. 
What we do is put that on our site directly. We write a request in Redis, then a jQuery notifier 
calls a script on the backend to see if the target part is online, with a link thats already populated with the target's name
and a room name.


I'd love some kind of feedback or suggestions for improvement. Lots of the code is cringe-worthy, but the basics of it work.
